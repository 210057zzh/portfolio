Covider is a Android mobile COVID risk control tool for universities and colleges. It allows users (students or professors) to report their symptoms daily, and allow professors to receive immediate notification on student's potential COVID risk. The professors can also update the instruction mode for their courses (remote or in-person), and students will get immediate notification.
### Architecture
This program is a serverless mobile application powered by Google's Firebase and FCM notification system. The program can be easily ported to support new organizations/universities by simply creating a new Firebase account.
